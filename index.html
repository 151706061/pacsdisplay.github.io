	<h3 class="divide">Background</h3>
		<p>The applications in this software package include programs for generating and installing DICOM grayscale look up tables (LUTs), a program to display a grayscale quality control test pattern, and features to perform QC evaluations of calibrated monitors. The present package release supports Microsoft Windows XP (32 bit), Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), and Windows 10.</p>
		
		<p>For monitor calibration, look up tables (LUTs) intended for the make and model of monitors used on your workstation need to be specified. The package distribution includes a LUT-Library with generic LUTs for various monitor models. This library is commonly searched to retrieve the required LUT. For monitor models that are not in the library, a gray palette needs to be obtained using one of the supported photometers. A LUT is then generated from the measured palette and a configuration file is  edited.</p>
		
		<p>For QC measures, the essential tools are distributed in a folder that does not require installation on a workstation. Typically this folder will be accessed from a USB memory device where a menu application is executed to select the desired application.</p>

	<h3 class="divide">OS Support</h3>

		<p>Package Release 5C now provides support for installation and use on Microsoft Windows 10 operating systems. The location of the LUT-Library and configuration files that need to be edited has been changed to the C:/Users/Public folder to conform with the current Microsoft policy regarding files installed in the Program Files folder.</p>

	<h3 class="divide">New Features</h3>

		<p>The X-Rite iOne Display Pro as been added to the photometer list. This modestly priced photometer is the currently recommended device for use with pacsDisplay programs. For this meter, color coordinates are now routinely obtained for all luminance measures. A meter application has been added that reports both illuminance and luminance as well as color coordinates. The meter application allows measurement of ambient illumination and ambient luminance. For quick QC validation of gray scale calibration, the white point color coordinates are now measure and gray tracking is reported.</p>

	<h3 class="divide">Open Source</h3>

		<p>The development of pacsDisplay applications began in 2002. The first public package, Release 3H, was organized in 2006 and made available on request under the Gnu general public license. Since then, Henry Ford Health System has made use of the programs for enterprise PACS workstation and within Radiology. Beginning with Package Release 5A, a more formal Open Source Project team is being formed with software distributed from an Open Source repository at GitHub. The project roadmap includes new features for color calibration and ICC profiles.</p>
