	<p>Thank you for your interest in downloading pacsDisplay. Please see the link below to continue downloading. </p>
	
	<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: For most Windows users, the security settings on your machine will automatically flag any file downloaded from the internet as potentially dangerous. This is what causes the initial security warning when you try to open downloaded files. Because of this, the downloaded version of pacsDisplay will be flagged after you've downloaded it. It is important that you "un-flag" the zipped file prior to unpacking it in order to avoid the security warning from being displayed every time an application is launched.</p>

	<p>The installation of pacsDisplay only moves files from the downloaded directory to Program Files, the Public Users folder, and the Start Menu. It makes no changes to the registry or system services.</p>
